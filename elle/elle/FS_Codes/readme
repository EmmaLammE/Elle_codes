To install these codes, copy to your elle directory (elle/elle The same folder that also contains the folders "processes/" or "basecode/").

To install, use FS_install.sh:

chmod +x FS_install.sh
FS_install.sh

Attention: The codes in "FS_other/" are NOT installed with this operation. To install them, or re-compile other codes, go to the corresponding directory containing the Imakefile. If the Makefile is not created yet, create it from the Imakefile by typing:

xmkmf

Afterwards compile (or re-compile) your code with the commands:

make install_wx
make clean

ALL codes will be installed in "elle/elle/binwx/". Change the Imakefiles if you wish to install them anywhere else.
