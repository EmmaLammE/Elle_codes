This is a code by Jens Roessiger. The following information is from his PhD thesis:

jr_gg_split â€“u 1 2 3 4 5 6

1.
    Splitmode (int 1, 2, 3)
    Splitmode 1: all grains have the same split chance
    Splitmode 2: every grain > min_area have the same chance to split.
    Splitmode 3: chance increasing. From < min_area = 0% to > max_area = 100%
2. 
    Splitchance (double between 0 and 1)
3. 
    Random forward (int): does a given number of random calls before the value is actually used.
    Further randomizes the simulation.
4.
    Starting step (int): In case of a restart. Influences the file numbering. This way a restart can be
    done in the same directory without overwriting files.
5. 
    Min_area (double): used by Splitmode 2 and 3
6. 
    Max_area (double): used by Splitmode 3


This code can be used with an existing Elle file to create a set of very small, but many, flynns. Using elle_gg on this set allows the user to achieve any desired initial grain size in a foam texture.
