--> BEFORE USING THIS SCRIPT: APPLY FS_postprocess_strainanalysis!!

This script reads finite position gradient tensors from ellefile (FS_postprocess_strainanalysis stored the data in U_ATTRIB_A to F) and calculates properties such as: vorticity, vorticity number, min/max strains, stretching direction, ratio of strain ellipse, dilation.

Usage:

FS_plot_strainanalysis -i file.elle -u A B -n

A: Dimension of points that store properties: 128,256 etc., does not have to be the unode dimension, it can be regarded as resolution of plot. The array of points will be in a regular grid of AxA points in case of a 1x1 box, otherwise the number of points in the direction of the long box edge.

DEFAULT: A is unode dim (128,256 etc.)

B: Additionally, the user has the chance to write certain data to a space delimited textfile: This file will have as many rows and columns as the plot point array (so can be plotted as a text-image). Input decides on which data is written to textfile:
B=0 (default): Do not write any text file
B=1 - Vorticity
B=2 - Vorticity number
B=3 - min strain
B=4 - max strain
B=5 - ratio of strain ellipse (max/min)
B=6 - max. stretching direction relative to pos. x-axis
B=7 - dilation
B=8 - ALL these properties (in total 7 text files)

For every point in AxA array, the code searches for the nearest passive marker storing the properties and assigns this property to the point. The following attributes will be occupied:

U_ATTRIB_A: Vorticity
U_ATTRIB_B: Vorticity number
U_ATTRIB_C: min strain
U_ATTRIB_D: max strain
U_ATTRIB_E: max. stretching direction (angle in degerees relative to positive x-axis, mathematical system for angles)
U_ATTRIB_F: ratio of strain ellipse (max/min)
U_VISCOSITY: Dilation, estimate for error as it should be 1 in area conservative deformation


HINT: With this script, you can also load the INCREMENTAL data from an Elle file (as producable by FS_postprocess_strainanalysis). However, these will not contain flynn or bnode data, but directly start with "UNODES"-block. If necessary, please add the flynn and bnodes blocks from the corresponding output Elle file
