Splits a flynn along two user defined bnodes. HANDLE WITH CARE! CAN MESS UP GRAIN SIZE STATISTICS!

Make sure you choose the right bnodes: They need to be double junctions! There is no additional check in the code.

The code automatically assigns the new flynn created by splitting to its unodes and updates U_ATTRIB_C, which is usually storing the respective flynn ID of the flynn that contains this unode

Usage:

FS_splitflynn -i file.elle -u bnode1 bnode2 flynn_split -n

flynn_split is the flynn ID of the flynn you want to split
