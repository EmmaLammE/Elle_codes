FS_statistics:

FS_statistics -i filename.elle -u A B -n

A: Determines which kind of statistics are extracted, default=0:
    A = 0: Area statistics
    A = 1: Read data in header from file all.out stored with the elle file (actually, the elle file is not necessary for this part)
    A = 2: Get work done by deformation from "all.out" file which has to be inside the same directory (NOT WORKING CORRECTLY YET)
    A = 3: Use the function "void CodeForFun()", which can be altered in the code according to the special needs of the user

B: Options for the statistics mode, default=0:
    If A = 0: No options implemented so far, only outputs a textfile with area statistics (or appends it to existing one)
    If A = 1: 
         B = 0: Just extract the data maybe for later use (which is not implemented yet)
         B = 1: Save file "vonMisesData.txt" that is a two column space seperated file with macroscopic von Mises stress in first and macroscopic von Mises strain in second column
    If A = 2:
        B = 1: Write output file, B = 0: Do nor write an output file

Attention:

Phases of the flynns have to be stored in VISCOSITY and need to be counted from 1 on without interruption, i.e. for 4 phases the phase IDs will be 1,2,3,4 and NOT 1,3,4,5!!!
