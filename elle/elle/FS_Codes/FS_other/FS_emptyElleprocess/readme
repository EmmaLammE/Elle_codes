This is an empty or "raw" Elle process. You can use it to start building your own Elle-module by adding code in "ProcessFunction" or whereever necessary.

Remember to alter the "Imakefile" if you rename or add *.cc files. 
The "Imakefile" is read by the software "imake" and will create a suitable Elle file. Check its content to understand how this works. Type:

xmkmf

to create a new Makefile and afterwards:

make install_wx

to compile. Afterwards you can type:

make clean

to remove temporary files.
