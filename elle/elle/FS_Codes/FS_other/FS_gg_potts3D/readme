INFO ABOUT INPUT
Dimension - Input 5: The number of points in each dimension
Stages - Input 6: The number of stages to perform the model, each stage will be stored in separate output txt file
RandomisationOff - Input 7: Points are accessed randomly, setting this to 1 switches the randomisation off
StartStep - Input 8: The number of stages already performed in initial file, only necessary for naming output files
 
Probability function:

    if dE > 0:      Pflip = P0 * exp (-c dE / k T) 
    if dE <= 0:     Pflip = P0      

T - Temperature - at the moment set to -30 째C = 243 K (ice) 

k - Boltzmann constant
dE - Energy difference between two states, calculated in code
             

DEFAULT VALUES IF NO INPUT IS SET OR INPUT == 0

P0 - Input 2: probability zero in probability function: 0.1
c  - Input 3: sensitivity factor c: Boltzman constant
T  - Input 4: temperature in 째C: -30째C is default
Dimension - Input 5: The number of points in each dimension: 32
    --> Dimension must match the dimension of points in input file!!
Stages - Input 6: set to 0 by default, i.e. perform no stages at all
RandomisationOff - Input 7: set to 0 by default, i.e. use randomisation

# # # # # INPUT FILE STRUCTURE # # # # #

Only has to contain two columns and as many rows as poins.
1st col: Points ID as running number ID from 0 to number of points
2nd col: State is random integer from 0-255 (or any other interval theoretically)

--> To create initial input files use the MATLAB code "MATLAB_create_3Dinitial_states.m" in the respective folder
