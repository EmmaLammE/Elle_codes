FS_DDEnergyRecovery

--> This code uses strain energies as driving force for recovery and allows the calculation of an angular velocity of each unode and hence the scaling to a numerical timestep. It needs a theoretical "rotational viscosity", which is actually a rate factor for recovery (see descriptions in appendix of Florian Steinbach's PhD thesis).
The code includes a simple model for calculating dislocation densities from misorientations (as used in FS_getmisoriDD).

Usage:

FS_DDEnergyRecovery -i file.elle -u A B C D E -n

A: Critical angle: High angle grain boundary angle, default: 0
B: ID of excluded phase (set to 0 not to use this, default: 0)
C: Switch off random picking of flynns, unodes etc. by setting this to 1, default: 0
D: Set initial "rotational viscosity", 0 is default but will lead to NO rotation
E: Set initial start step, 0 is default: usually start from 1st step
