This is a new version of fft2elle by Florian Steinbach

The main difference is that it computes incremental strain tensors to calculate new passive maker and bnode positions. These tensors can be used with the other "strain-analysis" codes by Florian to calculate finite strain tensors and properties such as vorticity, strain ellipse data, dilation etc.

Apart from this, this version of fft2elle is based on FS_fft2elle

Usage:

FS_fft2elle_strainanalysis -i file.elle -u A B -n

A: Read dislocation densities into file (1=yes, 0=no, default: 0)
B: Write strain tensor to text-file (1=yes, 0=no, default: 0)

Please notice that the output Elle file has a different name now: FS_fft2elle_strainanalysis.elle
